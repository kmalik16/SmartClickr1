										h3 Welcome to SmartClickr
										p SmartClickr is an all-in-one system that helps to increase audience participation and interaction. This guide will help you get your first poll up and running. Weâ€™ll also offer tips for managing your questions, viewing your graphs, and making sure your polls get into the right hands.
										p As for our system requirements, all you need is a modern browser. Internet Explorer 7 or higher works, but for a faster experience we recommend Firefox 3.5 or higher, Safari, or Chrome.
										p In this guide, you will learn how to:
										ol
											li Navigate your Command Center
											li Create Your First Poll
											li Choose the best question types
											li Edit your poll
											li Distribute your questions
											li Present to an audience

										h3 Your Command Center
										p The Connand Center is your home here at SmartClickr. It holds all the resources you need to get started including the create, edit, delete, start buttons as well as the urls needed to destribute your polls. Plus, it is friendly and will give you random, sometimes sassy greetings. 

									section#creating.sub-wrap.clearfix
										h3 Creating a Poll
										p To create a poll all you need to do is click on the create a poll button. You will then be taken to a page that allows you to enter the name for your poll. This is required because it allows us a way to make each poll unique. Plus we dont want you to get all your awesome polls confused. 
									section#qtypes.sub-wrap.clearfix
										h3 Question Types
										p Currently we have four different quesiton types:
										ol 
											li True/False
											li Multiple Choice
											li Free Response
											li Free Response Numeric

									section#editing.sub-wrap.clearfix
										h3 Editing your Poll
										p We understand that there will be times where you need to edit your polls after they have been created. All you need to do is click the edit button. This will take you to the edit page, which will allow you to add, delete, or change existing quesitons. 
									section#distribution.sub-wrap.clearfix
										h3 Distribution of your Poll
										p The easiest way to distrubte your poll is to just give out shown for the poll on the command center page. You can do this via email, facebook, twitter, or any other social network. Your participants will be taken right to the response page allowing them to cruise through your poll. 

									section#presentation.sub-wrap.clearfix
										h3 Presentation
										p If you wish to present your poll live, we have made this very easy for you to accomplish. Simply click the "Start" button for the poll on the command center page. If you are using a projector your audience will see the session code at the top of the page. They just need to navigate to smartclickr.com and type in this code. You can get started at any time because the session codes are at the top of each individual quesiton. 
										p We currently have two types of graphs for presentation purposes:
										ol 
											li Pie Charts
